Lets begin!

1) install the following extensions--openbar, blur my shell, forge, arc menu and user id to top panel.
2) in the openbar, enable auto themeing to match the bar theme with the background.
3) in blur my shell disable the panel blur.
4) install the given wallpaper up there, apply and refresh the open bar.
5) set up arc menu as you want.
6) install cava.
